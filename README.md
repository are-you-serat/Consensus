## Introduction
I had the task of finding Tor bridges and checking their functionality automatically since almost all Internet resources are blocked in my country, but I did not find a tool on Github that could do all the actions for me (maybe I was looking poorly). After that I decided to write this script myself. Perhaps this script is the only one that performs this task.

## Installation
To start, clone the repository using this link: https://github.com/seratclemency/Tor-bridges-parser.git. Click on install.bat which will create a virtual environment and install dependencies. After that, just click on run.bat.
